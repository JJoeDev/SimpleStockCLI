# SimpleStockCLI
This is a project that was made to cure my boredom, it is a simple CLI (command line interface) game that is mean't to act a little like a stock market.

It is defineatly not even close to be accurate to a real stock market but it was a fun project to create

It has only been tested for linux, but it may also be working for windows and apple, no promisses though

## Cheat guide

Yes that is true, you can cheat in this game. Simply open up the file called "StockSave" or "StockSave.json" and edit the different parameters. (This file will only be created after the game has run once)
